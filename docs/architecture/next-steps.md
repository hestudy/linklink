## Story Manager Handoff

**Prompt for Story Manager:**

Please begin implementation work based on this LinkLink AI Bookmark Manager brownfield enhancement architecture document. Focus on:

**Key Integration Requirements (Validated with User):**
- Must be fully compatible with existing Turborepo monorepo architecture
- Maintain integrity of existing Better-T-Stack technology stack
- Ensure seamless integration with existing Better Auth authentication system
- Extend existing Drizzle database schema while maintaining backward compatibility

**Existing System Constraints (Based on Actual Project Analysis):**
- Use existing React 19 + TanStack Router + Hono + tRPC + Drizzle technology stack
- Follow existing component architecture and code organization patterns
- Integrate into existing Turbo build and deployment processes
- Maintain consistency with existing shadcn/ui design system

**First Implementation Story Suggestions:**
1. **AI Service Infrastructure Setup** - Create AIService base class and OpenAI API integration
2. **Database Schema Extension** - Implement vector embedding and AI analysis result data models
3. **Basic AI Analysis Endpoint** - Create first tRPC AI analysis endpoint

**Implementation Sequence:**
- First implement core AI service architecture
- Then add database extensions
- Finally implement user interface components
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage at each stage

**Key Validation Points:**
- Existing bookmark functionality must continue to work normally
- New AI functionality must be controlled by feature toggles
- All integration points must be thoroughly tested
- Performance must meet existing SLA requirements

## Developer Handoff

**Prompt for Developers:**

Begin development implementation of the LinkLink AI Bookmark Manager system based on this brownfield enhancement architecture document. Reference this architecture document and existing coding standards.

**Key Integration Requirements (Validated):**
- Extend existing apps/web, apps/server, apps/extension structure
- Use existing TypeScript, React, Hono, tRPC technology stack
- Follow existing Drizzle ORM and database schema patterns
- Integrate with existing Better Auth authentication system

**Technical Decisions (Based on Real Project Constraints):**
- AI Services: OpenAI GPT-4 API + LangChain.js workflow orchestration
- Vector Database: Pinecone (recommended) or Weaviate
- Content Extraction: Cheerio + custom cleanup logic
- Caching Strategy: Redis or in-memory caching for AI results
- Error Handling: Graceful degradation and retry mechanisms

**Existing System Compatibility Requirements:**
- Existing API endpoints remain unchanged
- Database migrations must support rollback
- Frontend components must follow existing design system
- Must support gradual functionality enablement

**Implementation Sequence:**
1. **Phase 1: Core AI Services**
   - Create AIService infrastructure
   - Implement OpenAI API integration
   - Setup vector database connections

2. **Phase 2: Data Layer Extension**
   - Extend Drizzle schema
   - Create migration scripts
   - Implement data access layer

3. **Phase 3: API Endpoints**
   - Extend tRPC routes
   - Implement AI analysis endpoints
   - Add semantic search functionality

4. **Phase 4: User Interface**
   - Create AI analysis components
   - Extend existing bookmark interfaces
   - Implement intelligent search interfaces

**Verification Steps:**
- Run complete regression test suite
- Verify existing functionality unaffected
- Test new AI functionality performance
- Confirm security compliance
